  > This does a backup of your game's custom control mappings and stores it within the `BACKUPS` folder.
  > The backup location can be found in the root folder of SCUtil.

- **Backup screenshots**

  > This gives the user the ability to backup their Star Citizen screenshots within the `BACKUPS` folder.

- **Backup USER directory**

### 1.2 Clear data

- **Clear all data except p4k**

  > Clears all data in the `Star Citizen` folder except the `Data.p4k` file. This is useful
  > to sometimes clear out odd issues that pop up.

- **Clear `USER` folder**

  > Clears the `USER` folder in the `Star Citizen` folder. This allows for the exclusion of control mappings. This
  > is useful to clear issues relating to old user files.

- **Clear Star Citizen AppData (Windows AppData)**

  > This clears out error logs that are typically found within Star Citizen's App Data which sometimes prevent
  > the game from starting. There is also the option to exlude the renderer settings so that the game does not default 
  > back to DirectX.

- **Clear RSI Launcher AppData (Windows AppData)**

  > This clears out logs and cached items that are typically found within > the RSI Launcher's App Data which sometimes prevent the game from
  > starting.

### 1.3 Restore data

- **Restore control mappings**
  
  > Ability to restore previously backed up control mappings.

- **Restore characters (coming soon)**

  > Ability to restore previously backed up characters.

### 1.4 P4k data exploration

- **Reads all the filenames in the p4k data file**

  > This read all the filenames included wihtin the `Data.p4k` file and
  > writes it out to a file (`P4k_filenames.txt`). This is for the curious
  > individuals.

- **Search p4k filenames**

  > This features takes a phrase and searches for filenames within the
  > Data.p4k which contain the phrase. Also for the curious.

## 2. Running SCUtil

### 2.1. Executable

Simply download the release and place `SCUtil.exe` within any folder of your choosing (not in ProgramFiles). Set your game directory in settings. Any parent folder/drive to your Star Citizen installation can be selected as it will look for your installation. A `config.yaml` file should appear within the root directory of the `SCUtil.exe`. Below is a breakdown of the app's directory.
